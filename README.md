ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classification:

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Decision Tree Classification algorithm using Scikit-learn. It is designed to classify categorical outcomes based on input features using a tree-like structure.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps Covered:

Importing required libraries

Loading and exploring the dataset

Preprocessing data (if applicable)

Splitting data into training and test sets

Training a DecisionTreeClassifier model

Making predictions on test data

Evaluating model performance using:

    Accuracy Score

    Confusion Matrix

    Classification Report

Visualizing the decision tree (optional)

ðŸ›  Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn
